I spent one month in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in July 2016 so that I could experience the digital nomad life for real. I think I am like most people who watch the fantasy life portrayed by digital nomads and think wow, “Make money online while traveling the world” who wouldn’t want to do that? I don’t remember exactly how I got introduced to digital nomads but the people that really took my expectations to the next level were Riley Bennett and Chris the Freelancer; both digital nomad youtube vloggers. They both do a great job at capturing the highlights of the digital nomad lifestyle but of course only the highlights are shared. There are benefits and negatives that I experienced during my 1 month trip and in this post I will attempt to share everything that I experienced as a digital nomad.



To start, I should talk about my life “pre Chiang Mai.” It was full of inconsistency and uncertainty. I was attempting to become financially independent by freelancing as a PHP and Android developer but that wasn’t going well for me because I didn’t have enough skills or experience. I then attempted some entrepreneurial ventures like drop shipping and amazon fba but I did not follow through with that. I decided to attempt to build a web app for my favourite game ‘niche’ (Dota 2) and my goal was to create a working beta during my time in Chiang Mai. I did not already have an income source before heading to Chiang Mai but I had enough money to live for at least a month so I decided to go.



## The Epic Journey: Toronto -> Chiang Mai



I never bought a plane ticket before this trip so I was a complete noob and acted like one. I decided to try and find the cheapest round trip available so I went to google.ca/flights and began searching. It turned out “China Eastern / China Southern” airlines were the cheapest round trip available so I called a travel agent on FlightNetwork and got a round trip with insurance for about $1600 Canadian. That’s not so bad right? Wrong, this was the biggest mistake of my life.



I severely underestimated how grueling and stressful flying through China as a complete travel noob would be. My trip to Chiang Mai went like this: Toronto -> Shanghai (17 hour flight) with a 2 hour layover. Shanghai -> Kunming (2-3 hour flight) with a 13 hour layover. Kunming -> Chiang Mai (1.5 hour flight). I don’t know if traveling through all countries is as terrible as China but not being able to communicate with the people around you, at night, in a different country, being constrained by time, being sweaty and smelly from a long trip is quite awful.



I actually met some really nice Chinese folk who helped me so much. I was so weary about being scammed so I had my guard up but really if it wasn’t for the kindness of Chinese strangers I might be dead right now (probably not though). This one woman I sat next to on the plane to Shanghai told me about arrival cards and how I needed to fill one out. Then in Kunming some lady tried speaking Chinese to me so I replied in English and then she brought someone to speak English to me. This lady then offered me a hotel which I badly needed and so I went. If you can help it, try and reduce the number of connecting flights you have to take.



My experience at the Kunming airport and hotel was actually quite hilarious. My mindstate was like a shocked rat in a foreign environment, sensory overload on a fatigued and stressed brain. I was exhausted but not sleepy. I was weary but on guard. I was sweaty but stinky. It was also night time so I could not see anything except hordes of Chinese people everywhere. The lady wanted me to withdraw money from the ATM and I’m thinking: typical Chinese scam… but I had no choice so I did it. She wanted whatever amount of Chinese money, I asked to convert it to USD or Canadian and I think she said 40. I later did the conversion and she wasn’t scamming me. She then told me to follow this short Chinese man who would later buy me breakfast in the morning (not how it sounds…).



I enter a van taxi and in front is a Chinese man and a teenage Chinese boy. I say, “English?” and the teen turns around, smiles and says “a little.” In my head I’m thinking “THANK JESUS” and we start talking. I think he said his name was Lee. He says he thinks it’s brave and awesome that I’m traveling solo, I’m thinking meh it’s not a big deal to me. Lee goes to University in a place in Kunming, he tells me where but there’s no point because I don’t know anything about Kunming (which is a province in China). We connect pretty well and I half heartedly tell him to visit Toronto and I’ll show him around. I even take his phone number ‘just in case’ but months later I deleted him. I never communicated with him ever since that night. By the way the driving was pretty insane. Honking non stop, driving on the wrong side of the road, it was road anarchy.



## The Hotel That Was Kind

I checked in at the hotel but communication was very difficult. Thankfully Lee was there to help me out. I go to my room and immediately head to the washroom to take a shit and shower. As I just finish up a top 5 fart of my life (in length and volume) Lee knocks on my door and says, ‘hey wanna get food?’ I say one sec I’m in the washroom! He says, ‘oh I thought you wanted to get food?’ I say I do want to get food, I’m in the washroom just wait a second! He doesn’t understand and leaves. I’m sad because I wanted to get street food with Lee. After I shower I open my door and Lee has placed some snacks and drinks at my door, what a fucking lad! I fail to locate Lee, meekly shouting ‘Lee!’ around the floor to no avail.



So now I’m really all alone in this Kunming 2 star hotel with a squatting toilet. I tried to log onto the wifi but it’s not working. I want to leave my room to go downstairs and ask for help but I have no idea how the door locks and no way am I leaving my visa, wallet, and laptop unattended since my guard level is at 100%. I decide to just close my door and go downstairs and ask for help. As I go back up the door isn’t opening. I don’t know how to use the card lock so I’m thinking it’s locked from the inside and some asshole is in my room going through all my shit and planning on selling my identity to the Chinese black market. I literally freak out and my imagination is going crazy. I put my ear to the door to try and hear anything and I kind of hear what sounds like a Chinese man and a child (who probably were in another room). I bang on my door and shout, ‘HEY GET OUT OF MY ROOM!!!!!!!’ I stand there for like 5 minutes banging on the door not wanting this person to escape but I know I need to go downstairs for help. I sprint downstairs to the desk and make the front desk lady run upstairs, she has no idea what’s going on and I’m freaking out trying to explain that there’s an intruder in my room who’s trying to steal my identity! She takes the card key and places it in the slot that the card key is supposed to go and unlocks my door and my room was just as I left it, no one's in there. She was probably thinking, ‘relax you fucking moron, this place hasn’t been robbed in 2 weeks.’ I felt like the ultimate idiot.



Even after that whole situation the wifi in my room doesn’t work and I have to go downstairs to the lobby to use the internet. There’s no Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Google, Gmail, Reddit or anything really allowed in China. Thankfully Whatsapp is allowed and I ask my group chat if someone can check something in my Gmail. My friend replies yes. I ask him to double check something. He then says to do it myself. I am thinking how fucking useless can someone be. As I’m sitting on this couch the lady brings me a cup of hot water, that hospitality though! A group of what seems like 30 year old men and 1 woman enter the hotel smoking cigarettes. Seems like they’re traveling through Kunming as well? Even though Reddit was blocked, the Android app “Reddit is fun” still worked for some reason so I troll through Reddit before heading back to my room.



I think I flipped through the TV channels which wasn’t entertaining, read my kindle a bit I think I was reading ‘Models’ by Mark Manson at the time and then tried to sleep. I lied down in bed getting ready to sleep but my mind kept racing about everything that could go wrong. I was alone in China, in an area so incredibly foreign to me, my airplane to Chiang Mai leaves in 12 hours and have no idea how to get back to the airport.



I slept at like 4 or 5 am and woke up at 7 am completely alert. I start getting ready to leave but there was still like 8 hours left until my plane leaves. I look outside the window to the street below to take in the scenery. It’s very early so no one is up and about but I see a pair of stray dogs sniffing around the empty street. The street is kind of depressing. Everything is dusty, roads are crumbling, there are no colours, everything is grey or beige. As time passes some human activity arises. Some older Chinese people come out to sweep the streets, there is some sort of speaker radio activity broadcasting a message of some sort and I think it was repeated. People start walking around, biking around, driving around, more dogs appear and disappear. Me I’m just a Canadian boy looking out at a Kunming street wondering what the hell am I doing.



Showering in south east Asia is pretty hard. It’s so freaking hot and I sweat like a fountain so after I shower I start sweating which kind of negates the shower. I try and remain as motionless as possible but it doesn’t help. Oh and I took a shit in the toilet after flushing recently and it wouldn’t flush again for like 20 minutes. That was not a fun situation.



It’s like 7-8am at this point and I am so ready to just go to the airport and wait for my flight. I go downstairs all ready to leave and with my.phone and google translate I type in “Can you get me a taxi for the airport?” and show it to the front desk lady. She is kind of confused and gets the short man I saw at the airport. We start talking and by talking I mean I type something into google translate in “Chinese traditional” and show it to him. He reads it and speaks into his phone which then translates into English and I read it and that is how we talked. He asks if I can wait until 9am for a taxi, I say yes. I am just chilling on the couch and get another cup of hot water, heck yeah! The short man asks if I want to get breakfast with his phone and I’m thinking fuck it, may as well and we start walking down a Kunming street. In day time everything looks way less menacing and it’s just a regular street with restaurants and cars driving by. I’m thinking, ‘I’m pretty much a Kunming pro right now’ (I’m not). We walk down a few blocks and he takes me to this dumpling place where it seems like he knows the people. We sit and eat some dumplings and some soup, it’s pretty good. He speaks into his phone and shows it to me. It reads “I will pay for dinner” I’m thinking, ‘uhh I need to go to the airport soon’ and he just is like nodding his head and touching his chest like it’s not a problem. I’m confused and reach for my phone to try and tell him I need to leave soon but then I realize he means he will pay for this meal and I’m like ohh and we shake hands.



So finally it’s 9am and a van pulls up to take me to the airport, I say bye to the hotel staff because they were super sweet to me and finally in a good mood I head for my final flight of this journey. The van makes a few stops to pick up a bunch of young Chinese pairs of people. Girl boy, girl girl, it’s funny because there are 3 pairs of pairs that came in the van. We drive through the Kunming streets and it’s super interesting to see the sights while driving, I was thinking it would be an interesting video. There is of course a lot of honking and aggressive driving happening the whole time. The driver starts talking aggressively on the phone and we wait on the side of the road for like 10 minutes and the last pick up comes and it’s a solo male traveler. We head to the airport and then suddenly the last man gets dropped off on the side of the road. I imagine what it would be like to be dropped off there and the feeling of lost I would experience.



The Kunming airport looked so different in the daytime. It was quite a beautiful, incredibly tall structure with like 10 story floors. The outside view of the airport was so high, I had to tilt my head back and lose balance to see the top of it. It was quite a sight. I appreciated it more than when I saw the grand canyon. I think I like human made buildings more than nature made sights? I had like 7 hours until I had to check in for my flight but was beyond relieved to be at the airport. I spent the entire day walking around, carrying my luggage and exploring the airport. My socks were soaked with sweat in no time.



## Feet Finally Touch Chiang Mai Ground

After arriving in Chiang Mai I found an airport taxi for 40 baht to take me to my hotel. This driver filled me in the van with literally 2 different families and then dropped me off the side of the road, telling me this is my hotel. I asked where is it? He then pointed me in the wrong direction, telling me it’s a 30 second walk. So I’m walking down this street while it’s raining with my luggage and I can’t find it. I then ask some strangers where my hotel is and it’s in the complete other direction and like a 15 minute walk. A Thai person then offers to take me on the back of his motor bike to my hotel which was quite interesting.



So now I’m in my hotel room, exhausted, jet lagged and wondering what the fuck do I do now? I decided to do nothing but fuck around on the computer and go to sleep. I order food from the menu I see in my room. I call the number. Someone speaking Thai picks up. I say: “English?” and someone new speaks English to me. I order a chicken burger. A Thai lady comes to deliver it, she doesn’t speak English. I give her a 1000 baht bill, it’s the smallest I have. She tries to get me to give her a smaller bill, I try to explain I don’t have one. She sighs and I think she is coming back with change. I don’t think she wanted to do that. She comes back and gives me my change. I eat my food, it was good. I go to sleep but not before watching porn. Some porn sites are blocked by the Thai government it seems, but not all of them. I find it funny because people will have to know about what websites to block. They don’t know the best one.



I wake up in the morning, realizing that I need to get out of my room and actually do stuff. I didn’t travel through hell just to sit in my hotel room. I think maybe this was a mistake, I’m not really into doing stuff. I decide to just walk around the nearby area, Snapchatting the whole process. I see some stray dogs and I would pet them but they don’t look clean. I go into a 7/11 and buy a pack of smokes. The young man at the register speaks decent English and gives me a good recommendation on a pack, SMS? I enjoyed it. (I don’t smoke anymore, wouldn’t recommend it, I just wanted to try a pack of cigarettes from Thailand. I don’t think I’ll ever smoke again though.) Experienced Chiang Mai digital nomads tell me to just walk around and try and find an apartment I like. I walk into one that looks decent but I think it was around $250 USD a month for a tiny room without a balcony. I know I can find better.



I come back to my hotel room, at this point I am soaking with sweat and I need to take another shower. I ask on the hashtagnomads slack group what is a good apartment to find. Someone recommends me Baan Thai apartments, and it’s a winner. It seems as though the best way to find an apartment isn’t just walking around Chiang Mai looking at apartments, but to ask people for their experience. It’s 2016 and Chiang Mai isn’t a new destination anymore, a lot of people have lived here.



I walk around again, this time I need food. There’s a place up the road from my hotel that serves Kao Soi, which is a famous Thai dish. It’s like curry noodle soup with meat or other compliments in it. It’s good but not the tastiest thing I’ve ever had. My palate definitely needs some international ambition, but I am not a huge seeker of food; I do enjoy good food but wouldn’t call myself a ‘foodie’. In the future I will make more attempts to try and appreciate different types of food (except tarantulas or lizards…).



At this point I’m just lounging around my room, on the computer just wasting time. I found a new apartment I was going to move into and all that I needed to do was move. So here I am at my hotel, browsing the interwebs like always and sometimes going outside to smoke a cigarette. Sitting outside my hotel on a bench facing a small side street in day time, smoking a cigarette and looking around, I realize I could be anywhere on the planet and everything could be the same. I could be in Toronto, sitting on a bench smoking a cigarette and 2 Asian ladies could walk past me like the exact same situation I was experiencing in Chiang Mai. The idea that we are all the same strengthens its grip in my mind. I move into my new apartment and begin the REAL part of my trip.
