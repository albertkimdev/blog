## Part 2: My new HOME(?)

I was only staying in Chiang Mai for 21 days at my new apartment but it was my new home. A major component of being a digital nomad involves being homeless. This means bouncing around from place to place, and staying in 1 place for over a month is considered LONG.



My new apartment was Baan Thai Apartment, you can find more information here https://chiangmaibuddy.com/product/baan-thai-chiang-mai/. Right off the main Nimman road and walking distance to a lot of areas of interest. It cost 5800 baht or $166 USD for 1 month but it requires a 3 month deposit. So that means you need 18000 baht to move in which was a lot of my budget so that was quite annoying but not the most annoying thing ever. I just withdrew some money later in the month.



It’s a decent pad, has 2 chairs and minimal table space. The chairs were not ergonomic or comfortable in the slightest. The bed had a hard mattress and cheap sheets but I ain’t one to complain. There was an entire wall of closet so if you had a lot of things that wouldn’t be an issue but digital nomads have a stereotype of being minimalistic, which I am proudly! There was a working TV that would have been fantastic in 2003 but in 2016 we have slightly higher expectations of electronics. It had cable and a lot of channels including BBC, Aljazeera english, Fox news, I think a k pop themed channel (which I was helpless in watching) and a bunch of other channels you would find on a cable package except Thai style. The washroom was decent but the shower had no curtain so there would be water in unfortunate places after a shower.



I didn’t bring any towels with me so I went to Maya mall http://www.mayashoppingcenter.com/ to find some towels and glasses to drink out of. I bought 3 towels for I think 120 baht each which is a god damn rip off but I had little choice. I used the towels without dusting them so I was covered with dust and lint after I used the towel which was insanely annoying. Then I did laundry with the dusty towels and the dust and lint got in all my clothes, even more annoying! Remember to dust your dusty towels before you use them! Especially if you buy them at Maya Mall!



I remember my first night in my new apartment. I had some Chang beers and was going to get some street meat from outside for dinner. So I got some grilled chicken on a stick and got my beer, I am ready to party! I don’t have a bottle opener so I go outside to the hall and use the staircase railing as a bottle opener. Some paint chips off, whoops! Now I’m ready to drink beer and eat some Thai street chicken! 1 bite and holy shit that is the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted in my life. 1. It didn’t taste like chicken, 2. The texture was so disgusting, it was like chewy, plasticy, weird, didn’t feel like meat, it was like all cartilage or something, 3. The after taste was even worse. Literally ruined my night, I went to sleep hungry. The Chang beer was also quite heavy and difficult to finish. It was like a 750ml bottle to. My first experience with Thai street food went awfully.



At around 5am the fire alarm goes off. I’m considering just lying in bed because I can just jump off my 2nd floor balcony if there’s a real fire. I decide to just go outside. A nice young white lad gives me a head nod, as if he’s trying to conversate. I use the excuse that it’s 5am to not be polite and conversate, really I was just being shy. So like 20 people or so are outside the apartment literally wasting time for like 10-20 minutes. I could have stayed inside, but then I wouldn’t have been able to stand awkwardly beside all these digital nomads! Much social. I see a jacked brown guy standing outside as well not talking to anyone. This turned out to be Andrew Sunil, a fellow digital nomad I would meet the next day playing basketball. He also vlogs on Youtube.



## Meeting People

Meeting people is pretty important. One thing I learned while in Thailand is that if you have a desire to meet new people traveling is actually the easiest thing in the world. I literally had to go out of my way to stop meeting new people. I am an INTP (personality trait you can find yours here https://www.16personalities.com/), which is someone who is more introverted than extroverted. Meeting new people can be quite draining energy wise. I met 2 groups of lads in my first week and then was solo the entire time or with either of those 2 groups.



There are also plenty of meetups that happen every week in Chiang Mai. I’m not proud to say I never went to any of them. My next location I plan on pushing myself out of my comfort zone and just going to a meet up so that I may meet up!



## Basketball Lads

The first group of people I met were some fellows by the name of Todd, Biron, Andrew, Tanveer, Greg, Jeremiah, and maybe some other people. I met them at the Chiang Mai University basketball court because Todd posted a message on the Chiang Mai digital nomad Facebook group about looking for people to play basketball with. Me being the huge basketball fan of course replied and went to play. Everyone was super cool, nice and all of us being self proclaimed digital nomads meant we had a common ground to connect on. Those lads were from Michigan, Boston, London, India, Vancouver, and California. Pretty cool how different people from all around the world can gather in 1 ‘digital nomad hub’ and connect just from being lads and playing basketball. We talked about different cities, they asked about the girls and dating scene in Toronto and I tried my best to give an honest answer which was: they’re beautiful but have high expectations.



I would go on to meet with these ballers a bunch more times during my stay and the times we played basketball were probably the highlight of my trip. Sports are super sick because it’s a great way to connect with people from a common activity. You don’t need to speak the same language but passing the ball helps. When it gets competitive it can get pretty intense, but it’s all for fun. I was even a member of the basketball group chat that they had! Leaving that group chat was one of the hardest things I’ve had to do but since I left Chiang Mai, there was no reason for me to stay and I didn’t want to seem like I was desperate for their friendship! Being a part of that chat helped so much with battling loneliness.



## Toronto Boys

The second group of people I met during my trip were 3 Chinese lads from Toronto. All 28 at the time I believe and they all went to school together. 3 very smart, very capable and highly accomplished lads were just chillen with this (me) 24 year old, 2 time college drop, unemployed lad. I felt a little out of place but we’re all the same...right? Fortunately we had plenty to connect on, being from Toronto, being an oriental lad growing up in Toronto, being coders and being digital nomads in Chiang Mai!



They were named Adrian, Heyse and Matt. I met up with them because I talked to Adrian a few times in the hashtagdigitalnomads slack group. He was the one who directed me to Baan Thai apartments and also invited me to get lunch with his crew. I was hesitant to go because of stupid social anxiety reasons but going to that lunch was probably the best decision I made during my trip. The lunch was a great time, eating at a restaurant that I would have never gone to by myself. It was like 35 or 40 baht for a plate of delicious noodles and some meat and soup. I would end up going to Burmese library and restaurant like everyday after that. We talked about digital nomad stuff like Pieter Levels, different cities, different lifestyles. We talked about our background and ‘stories’ and even discovered that they knew the CEO of a startup I worked for! I exposed all the secrets of that start up to the boys.



These lads definitely showed me the work ethic required to accomplish anything. It was pretty funny how I would wake up, walk around, and then see them at the same Burmese restaurant. We would talk, and I would ask, ‘you working?’ and they would always reply yup, while I would have just woken up or have been doing something unproductive. I would then see them again at night the same day and be like, ‘you working?’ and they would be like yup since we last saw each other, while I would have wasted my entire day. This literally happened multiple times a week.



I was also quite envious of the situation they had. I traveled to Thailand by myself, knowing that no one I knew would be down for the movement. These fellows had 2 friends with them that they knew for years, had the same interests and were helping each other travel further in life. That’s the way to go for sure.



## Meeting People Experience

When you come to a hub like Chiang Mai, you are bound to meet like minded people. I put in the smallest amount of effort and met a dozen people. Put in an above average amount of effort and you just might make 10 new best friends for life.



Meeting local Thai people for me was incredibly awkward. I was always self conscious about myself being an ‘outsider’ and was rejecting the Thai people before they could reject me. I illogically assumed that everyone thought of me as a leech on Thai society, exploiting them for their cheap cost of living and giving nothing back. I know this isn’t true and that I should break free from the bonds of my logical fallacies but hey if it were that easy than I would have done it right? There were so many (white) people in the hashtagnomads slack group that would brag about how many Thai friends they had. I found it so hilarious because it reminded me of the supremely lame white people back in North America that would brag about how my best friend is black! The digital nomad version is: my best friend is Thai!



There was one fellow, Tanveer from India, who really exemplified an ideal way to interact with Thai people. He actually found Thai friends that he would hang out with, and practice speaking English and Thai together. My mentality was that: the language barrier was too high, I was only there for 1 month and deep down the truth was I didn’t want to put in the effort. The pay off probably would have been great (making new friends?) but my time there was so temporary that I didn’t even try.
