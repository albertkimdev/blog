  In this article series we will be dissecting and examining UI/UX components of
  web app start-ups. By examining how other developers and designers have
  implemented their UI/UX, we will be better able to create our own web apps and
  UI/UX.

This article will look at 4 different web apps that I am a personal fan of.

[NomadList.com](https://nomadlist.com/), [ProductHunt.com](https://www.producthunt.com/), [IndieHackers.com](https://www.indiehackers.com/), [Carrd.co](https://carrd.co/) are all web apps whose founders are active on Twitter and in the indie hacking community and I will be examining their UI/UX.

We will be examining the sign up/sign in section of these web apps. This section or component of a web app is crucial as it is how a person can become a user of your web app. 

If you are making a digital product that has user specific functionality then nailing the user sign up or registration UI/UX is crucial.

How should you make a sign up / sign in component? Should you create a new page or create a modal that pops up? Should you use Oauth services like Facebook and Twitter to let people create accounts? Do you use buttons for logins? What should the buttons look like?

Rather than answering these kinds of questions with opinions and statements, let’s look at examples of successful web apps with real paying users. 

Let’s begin by examining one of my favourite digital products: NomadList.com
